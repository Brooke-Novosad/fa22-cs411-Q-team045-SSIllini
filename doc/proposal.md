# Project Proposal

## Describe what data is stored in the database. (Where is the data from, what attributes and information would be stored?)

## What are the basic functions of your web application? (What can users of this website do? Which simple and complex features are there?)

## What would be a good creative component (function) that can improve the functionality of your application? (What is something cool that you want to include? How are you planning to achieve it?)

## Project Title

## Project Summary:  It should be a 1-2 paragraph description of what your project is.

## Description of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you want to solve, etc.?

## Usefulness. Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.  Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there?  If so, what are they, and how is yours different?

## Realness.  Describe what your data is and where you will get it.

## Description of the functionality that your website offers. This is where you talk about what the website delivers. Talk about how a user would interact with the application (i.e. things that one could create, delete, update, or search for). Read the requirements for stages 4 and 5 to see what other functionalities you want to provide to the users. You should include:

## A low fidelity UI mockup: What do you imagine your final applicationâ€™s interface might look like? A PowerPoint slide or a pencil sketch on a piece of paper works!

## Project work distribution: Who would be responsible for each of the tasks or subtasks?

## List of the person responsible for which exact functionalities in section f. Explain how backend systems will be distributed across members. Be as specific as possible as this could be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.
