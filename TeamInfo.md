## Project Summary

Greener Pastures is a web-based habit tracker that serves as an organized checklist for building a person's ideal schedule. For a student, this looks like attending classes, set aside study time, and time for other hobbies. It also can incorparate a regular sleep schedule and exercise routinue. The main purpose of the application is to build organized task-orientated habits.
As a way to track progress, users will be rewarded with a pet/creature with randomly assigned color scheme. The more a user sticks to their schedule the more rare their creatures will be, signified by more exotic color schemes.
